**Severity:** Low
**Workaround:** Current animations are clear and functional
**Fix Priority:** Phase 3 Polish

#### 4. Placeholder Audio System
**Issue:** Audio system exists but no actual sound effects implemented
**Impact:** No audio feedback for actions
**Severity:** Medium
**Workaround:** Visual feedback compensates for missing audio
**Fix Priority:** Phase 3 Essential

#### 5. Limited Equipment Tooltips
**Issue:** Equipment comparison tooltips could show more detailed information
**Impact:** Players need to calculate some stat changes manually
**Severity:** Low
**Workaround:** Basic stat changes are shown
**Fix Priority:** Phase 3 Quality-of-Life

### Technical Debt

#### 4. Accessibility Features
**Issue:** Limited accessibility options (screen readers, colorblind support)
**Impact:** Reduced accessibility for some players
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Basic accessibility maintained
**Action:** Comprehensive accessibility audit in Phase 3

### Performance Considerations

#### 1. Memory Usage Growth
**Issue:** Memory usage slowly increases during very long play sessions (4+ hours)
**Impact:** Potential performance degradation in marathon sessions
**Severity:** Low
**Measurement:** 285MB baseline, grows to ~350MB after 4 hours
**Workaround:** Restart game after extended sessions
**Fix Priority:** Phase 3 optimization

#### 2. Combat Effect Pooling
**Issue:** Combat effects create/destroy objects frequently
**Impact:** Minor GC pressure during intense combat
**Severity:** Low
**Measurement:** No noticeable impact on 60fps target
