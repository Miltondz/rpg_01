3. **Save System** (Task 10) - Party state persistence

## Usage

```javascript
// Initialize the party system
const characterSystem = new CharacterSystem();
const partyCreationUI = new PartyCreationUI(characterSystem);
const characterSheetUI = new CharacterSheetUI(characterSystem);

// Show party creation interface
partyCreationUI.show();

// Show character sheet for specific character
characterSheetUI.show(characterId);
```

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the tactical party-based gameplay that will be central to the dungeon crawler experience.
