# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A retro-style first-person dungeon crawler game built with Three.js and vanilla JavaScript, inspired by Eye of the Beholder. The game features grid-based movement, 3D first-person perspective, smooth animations, and classic dungeon exploration mechanics. Phase 1 focuses exclusively on the core movement and rendering engine.

## Glossary

- **Grid System**: A discrete coordinate system where the game world is divided into 2x2 meter tiles
- **Player**: The controllable character that moves through the dungeon
- **Tile**: A single grid cell that can contain floor, wall, door, or transition elements
- **Movement Controller**: System that handles player movement, rotation, and animation
- **Collision System**: System that validates movement and prevents walking through walls
- **Door System**: Interactive elements that can be opened/closed and may require keys
- **Dungeon Loader**: System that loads level data from JSON files and generates 3D geometry
- **Renderer**: Three.js-based 3D rendering system
- **Input Manager**: System that captures and processes keyboard input

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to move through a 3D dungeon using keyboard controls, so that I can explore the game world naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses W or Arrow Up, THE Movement Controller SHALL move the player forward one grid tile in the current facing direction
2. WHEN the player presses S or Arrow Down, THE Movement Controller SHALL move the player backward one grid tile opposite to the current facing direction
3. WHEN the player presses A or Arrow Left, THE Movement Controller SHALL rotate the player 90 degrees counterclockwise
4. WHEN the player presses D or Arrow Right, THE Movement Controller SHALL rotate the player 90 degrees clockwise
5. WHEN the player presses Q, THE Movement Controller SHALL move the player one grid tile to the left without changing facing direction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth animations when moving and turning, so that the movement feels natural and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any movement action is initiated, THE Movement Controller SHALL interpolate the camera position over 250 milliseconds using ease-out cubic easing
2. WHEN any rotation action is initiated, THE Movement Controller SHALL interpolate the camera rotation over 200 milliseconds using ease-out cubic easing
3. WHILE any animation is in progress, THE Input Manager SHALL block all movement input to prevent animation conflicts
4. THE Renderer SHALL maintain 60 frames per second during all movement animations
5. WHEN an animation completes, THE Movement Controller SHALL set the exact target position to prevent floating-point accumulation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be prevented from walking through walls and obstacles, so that the game world feels solid and realistic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player attempts to move to a tile with type 'wall', THE Collision System SHALL block the movement and provide feedback
2. WHEN the player attempts to move to a tile outside the dungeon boundaries, THE Collision System SHALL block the movement
3. WHEN the player attempts to move to a tile with type 'door' and the door is closed, THE Collision System SHALL trigger door opening if unlocked
4. IF a door is locked and the player lacks the required key, THEN THE Collision System SHALL block movement and display a message
5. THE Grid System SHALL ensure the player is always positioned at the exact center of a grid tile

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with doors by opening them, so that I can access new areas of the dungeon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player moves into a tile containing an unlocked door, THE Door System SHALL automatically initiate door opening animation
2. WHEN a door opening animation is triggered, THE Door System SHALL slide the door geometry 1.5 meters perpendicular to its orientation over 300 milliseconds
3. WHEN a door opening animation completes, THE Door System SHALL mark the tile as walkable and allow player passage
4. WHEN the player presses Space while facing a locked door, THE Door System SHALL check for required key and display appropriate feedback
5. THE Door System SHALL support both vertical and horizontal door orientations with correct slide directions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to move between different levels of the dungeon, so that I can explore multi-floor environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player moves to a tile with type 'transition', THE Dungeon Loader SHALL initiate level transition with fade effect
2. WHEN level transition begins, THE Dungeon Loader SHALL fade screen to black over 300 milliseconds and block input
3. WHEN new level loads, THE Dungeon Loader SHALL position the player at the specified spawn coordinates and direction
4. WHEN level transition completes, THE Dungeon Loader SHALL fade screen from black over 300 milliseconds and restore input
5. THE Dungeon Loader SHALL dispose of previous level geometry and load new level data from JSON format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game to load dungeon layouts from JSON files, so that levels can be easily created and modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dungeon Loader SHALL parse JSON files containing grid dimensions, tile data, door definitions, and spawn points
2. WHEN loading a level, THE Dungeon Loader SHALL convert tile array indices to 3D geometry using the Grid System
3. THE Dungeon Loader SHALL create floor meshes for walkable tiles and wall meshes for barrier tiles
4. THE Dungeon Loader SHALL instantiate door objects at specified coordinates with correct properties
5. THE Dungeon Loader SHALL register transition tiles with target level and spawn information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want consistent performance during gameplay, so that the experience remains smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Renderer SHALL maintain 60 frames per second in dungeons up to 20x20 tiles
2. THE Dungeon Loader SHALL complete level loading in less than 1 second for standard dungeon sizes
3. THE Grid System SHALL provide tile lookup operations in constant time complexity
4. THE Renderer SHALL use optimized geometry techniques such as instanced meshes for repeated elements
5. THE Game Loop SHALL prevent memory leaks during extended gameplay sessions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual feedback about my current position and status, so that I can understand my location in the dungeon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Renderer SHALL display current grid coordinates in a debug panel
2. THE Renderer SHALL show current facing direction using cardinal notation (N, E, S, W)
3. THE Renderer SHALL display current frame rate for performance monitoring
4. WHEN system messages occur, THE Renderer SHALL show temporary toast notifications for 2-3 seconds
5. THE Renderer SHALL provide fog effects to limit visibility and create atmospheric depth
